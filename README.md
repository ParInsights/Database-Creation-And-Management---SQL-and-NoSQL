# Database-Administration-And-Database-Management
This repo examines data structures, file organizations, concepts, and principles of database management systems (DBMS) as well as data analysis, database design, data modeling, database management, and database implementation. More specifically, it introduces hierarchical, network, and relational data models; entity-relationship modeling; basics of Structured Query Language (SQL); data normalization; and database design. Using Microsoftâ€™s Access and SQL Server DBMSs as implementation vehicles, this repo provides hands-on experience in database design and implementation. It also demonstrates advanced database concepts such as transaction management and concurrency control, distributed databases, multitier client/server architectures, web-based database applications, data warehousing, and NoSQL.

1. Relational Data Modeling
2. Conceptual Modeling

The Final Project was a project completed for a friend who owned a few local bars and concert venues. He was looking to create a database where he would be able to book local musicians, sell merchansise, manage inventory, and review sales for his various venues.
